                            outcomes to our client, Asma Shakil. Our team’s name is simple in origin. When we were 
                            filling out our team forming sheet, we struggled to come up with a name. As we considered 
                            asking ChatGPT to suggest a cool name, we thought, "Why not name our team after ChatGPT?" 
                            And so, here we are with a website designed by ChatGPT.</p>
