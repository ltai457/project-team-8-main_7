## Project Information
The project is a product of the University of Auckland Capstone Course Compsci 399. Its main purpose is to provide a platform for students who have enrolled in the Capstone course to showcase the projects they have developed. It is a website where students can upload demo video links, explaining the functionality or flow of their projects. They can also include the poster image, GitHub links, and the names of the participants who contributed to the project. Users have the ability to like and comment on the videos, subject to certain conditions. By developing this website, the developers aim to increase the visibility and reach of the Capstone course, making it more influential and accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, it may create potential employment opportunities as potential employers could come across the website and discover the projects showcased by the students.

## Deployment

## Future Plans
- The filter on our website page could be improved with more detailed categories.
- The website would be perfect if it could combined with big data. As we are hoping the profile page is more of a page for potential students who wants to enroll in this course to have others who share the same interest team up with them after viewing their profiles. Therefore, with big data, the algorithm will push this kind of students profiles to any student users.
